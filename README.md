# Python Number Guessing Game 🎮

## Overview
This is a simple Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50.

## What I Learned
- Using functions
- Working with loops
- Writing conditional statements
- Handling user input

## How It Works
1. The program generates a random number.
2. The user enters guesses.
3. The program gives feedback (too high / too low).
4. The game ends when the correct number is guessed.

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels
- Add limited attempts
- Add score tracking
